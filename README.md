# Flood_Prediction_Group_21
- Machine Learning algorithms to predict the chances of Flood in the state of Kerala using the Kerela flood dataset.
- This Model uses 5 Machine Learning Algorithms namely KNN Classification, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest to get the best possible model to predict the floods using Kerela Rainfall Data.
- This code requires several python libraries like scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy and os
